# Leads Tracker Chrome Extension

Chrome extensions are the programs that enhance the Chrome Browser experience.
Sales teams spend countless hours tracking down their leads(potential clients or customers) or sourcing leads and they 
look for people online who are interested in their product and they keep saving the leads. So, the chrome extension that I will built wasa tool for these people online so that when they open any social media site(LinkedIn, Twitter,
Facebook, Github, etc.) they can track and save their leads.

## Technical details 

This project was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Concepts of localStorage etc. are also used in it.

## The extension looks something like this ðŸ‘‡
